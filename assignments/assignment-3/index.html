    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     I am a first generation undergrad studying Computer Science at San Francisco State University. I held leadership
     roles in my high-school and community college coding clubs, where I collaborated on projects and mentored novice
     members in computer science fundementals. For the focus of my career, I am extremely passionate about blockchain technology as it offers a
     tamper proof data storage solution for the first time in human history. Excitingly this solution can be applied to
     various fields and industries to improve inclusivness, speed, relyability, and security.

      <p>
       A proof of concept game that gives players the name and logo of 3 random crypo tokens from CoinGecko's public
       API. Players can then pick which of the three has the highest price, guessing right earns a point while guessing
       wrong ends the game. "Now you can simulate making important financial decisions on crypto tokens only using their
       name and logo. Just like a real crypto trader!"

     <h4 >Blockchain Technology</h4> &nbsp;
     <img src="images/Blockchain.png" width="40" alt="skateboard photo">
     <p>I love blockchain technology as this innovation has completely blown me away with its ability to solve many of the unsolvable problems we have today. 
      In March of 2021 I read the bitcoin whitepaper where I learnd that bitcoin is a “peer-to-peer network [that] timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of 
      hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work” (Nakamoto, 2008). Immediatly I realized the potential for such a technology 
      to revolutionize various industries improving their inclusivness, speed, relyability, and security. Around the same time I realized that, while bitcoin is a great proof of concept
      it is in no way scalable, the more users it has the worse the network performs so I knew there was still a lot of work to do to
      make these blockchains actually useful, but once the frameworks are inplace and the laws catch up, this tech has limitless potential. 
      <br><br>For a detailed look into how blockchain works and the specific problems with bitcoin please read my <a href="images/Blockchain%20Revolution,%20Bitcoin%20Problem.pdf">full article</a>.</p>

     <h4>Skate Boarding</h4>
     <img src="images/PennyBoard.png" width="100" alt="skateboard photo">
     <p>Whether I'm crusing around campus on my neon blue penny board, or shredding the skatepark with my full-sized board
      I just love the feeling of freedom I get when riding my board. After so many years it honestly feels like an extention of my body, skateboarding feels just as natural as walking now.</p>

     <h4>Animation</h4>
     <p>As a kid one of my all time favorite passtimes was creating flipbook animations. Just being able to transition my creative ideas into moving images was so amazing to me. 
      As I grew older I started adapting this hobby to start making simple digital animations. Eventually I moved onto more complex forms of animation with my favorite being 3D animations! Below is my very first digital animaition as well as a snippet of my latest project.</p>
