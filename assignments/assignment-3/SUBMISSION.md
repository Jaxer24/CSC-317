# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
I noticed that the MLMs took a very similar approach as I did by simply 
styling everything in order from top to bottom making the CSS easier to 
read and follow.  We all tried to separate the header, sections, and footer 
using different colors and more specifically we all used floating rounded 
boxes for displaying the content, I believe this is simply a universally 
common method for displaying content hence why it is reflected in modern 
MLMs that learn off of human code samples. One difference I noticed was 
that I tried my best to keep content within boarders and at a reasonable 
size, whereas the MLMs did not consider how large elements such as images 
would break the flow of the webpage. For the first AI response I really 
enjoyed the little animations found throughout the page like how elements 
would grow in size when hovering over them along with little embellishes 
such as a dotted border, these are the main takeaways I incorporated into 
my hybrid design. However the animations for the first AI response were too 
crazy especially the rotating footer that made it almost impossible to read 
the content, so I had to dial it down for my version. For the second AI 
response I gave it a matrix theme to jump off from and I really enjoyed the 
animations found throughout the page such as the flickering letters which I 
added to my dark theme, but more specifically I liked how it condensed my
content into scrollable windows making the website easier to scroll through. 
Unfortunately the scrolling behavior was programmed poorly, however for my 
hybrid version I was able to get smooth snap scrolling working.


## Lessons Learned
I learned so many different aspects of CSS and how I can combine it within my HTML and JS 
Structures to crete dynamic and asthetic designs for my webpage. Before this assignment
I did not comprehend how much css can transform a page and I much less knew how to develop a 
webpage design. reading and learning from the AI responses helped me open my mind to the different
ways I could be using css to engance my html.

## Preferred Version
I prefer the hybrid version as I kept my original bright but mild green and brown asthetic from 
my first itteration that I really enjoyed. However I also was able to condense a lot of the content
such as in the second AI response using horizontal scrollbars, this really cleans up the look of the page
and makes it easier to navigate, especially for mobile users who would otherwise have to scroll through all
of the content to navigate the page. I also like the animations and transitions I was able to put into the page
as I feel like they enhace the page while not distracting from the content or disrupting the gneral flow
of the page or it's readability. I admit I really like the easter egg I put in where if you hover over a 
navigation link for 9 seconds it's animation goes crazy as it makes me feel like I have good control over how my 
animations to play.
