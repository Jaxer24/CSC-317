Brief description of your implementation (100-200 words):
    For this assignmment I had to practice extensive problem solving as I struggled with part 1, making the calculator, 
    simply because I chose to dive head into the assignment without properly planing or prepairing my layout or general 
    strategy. This lead to me discovering many errors that I had to fix along the way painstakingly, and this has served 
    as a learning expereince for me. I tried to condense my code and reuse the same functions for both the keyboard and 
    click events to keep my code efficient, however my javascript still ended up being long, I do feel like I could condense
    the code further but it would not drastically improve the end product. In the future I will make sure to set up the css 
    layout before I start my javascript as trying to fix it after the fact got complex fast. 


Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them:
    I found the CSS portion of the assignment more 
    difficult than the javascript portion because I am very used to javascript, however struggling to get the CSS working 
    right helped me learn a lot of the fundemental mechanics behind the language. At first I tried to handle the dynamic
    sizing of the calculator using relative units such as %, fr, and vw/vh for each element in the calculator. This was 
    extremely problematic as resizing the page caused many issues, so I ended up using a series of 5 media queries that 
    statically change the calculator size depending on screen width, while not as clean or dynamic as I wanted it to look
    I think it works well. I also had a huge problem with displaying the % symbol in my calculator so I had to create a work
    around that turned numbers into their decimal form instead of showing them in percent form, while this mathematically 
    works the same I do wish I could have fixed this to make it more accurate to the real app.
    
Any additional features or improvements you added beyond the requirements:
    The only extra bit I added that is not in the requirments is a scrollbar that allows users to handle larger numbers since
    they won't be hindered by the display size, I think this feature makes the calculator act like a ti-84 that also has the 
    scrolling, I simply thought it was a better way of implementing the display rather than having numbers cut off or shrink 
    too small.
    
Acknowledgment of any resources, tutorials, or code snippets you used:
    I used the secureEval function provided in discord.
